# 🛡️ DoS Attack Testing Code

This repository contains a simple script to simulate **Denial of Service (DoS)** attack scenarios for **educational and testing purposes only**.
It is designed to help developers understand how servers behave under heavy load and to test mitigation strategies like rate limiting.

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This code is strictly for **local testing and educational use only**.
Do **not** run it against systems, APIs, or services you don’t own or don’t have explicit permission to test.
Misuse may be **illegal**.

---

## 🚀 Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd dos-attack-test
   ```
2. Install dependencies (if required).
3. Run the script against your **local/test server**.

---

## 📖 Description

The code repeatedly sends multiple requests to the target server in a short time frame to mimic a DoS scenario.
It helps developers test:

* Rate limiting
* Server resilience under load
* Logging and alerting systems

---

## ✅ Best Practices

* Use only on **local environments** or with **written permission**.
* Combine with monitoring tools to analyze server performance.
